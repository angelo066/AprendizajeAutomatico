    Parameters
    ----------
    theta1 : array_like
        Weights for the first layer in the neural network.
        It has shape (2nd hidden layer size x input size + 1)

    theta2: array_like
        Weights for the second layer in the neural network. 
        It has shape (output layer size x 2nd hidden layer size + 1)

    X : array_like
        The inputs having shape (number of examples x number of dimensions).

    y : array_like
        1-hot encoding of labels for the input, having shape

    lambda_ : float
